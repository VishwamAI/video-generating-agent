# Initialize Repository Structure

This pull request initializes the repository structure for the `video-generating-agent` project. The following directories and files have been created:

- `data/`: Directory for datasets
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained models
- `scripts/`: Directory for scripts (e.g., training, preprocessing, model conversion, auto-update)
- `notebooks/`: Directory for Jupyter notebooks
- `logs/`: Directory for training logs and metrics
- `docs/`: Directory for documentation
- `config/`: Directory for configuration files
- `utils/`: Directory for utility scripts and functions
- `setup.sh`: Script for setting up the environment
- `requirements.txt`: File for specifying required dependencies

This structure will provide a solid foundation for the development of the video generating agent.
